# InventoryManager
A simple inventory management application in C++

The program reads the 3 CSV files into memory and displays them as a table.
The program then asks the user to enter the name of one of the animals and the letter corresponding to its type. The program will then print the paternal tree for the animal entered. For example, "D Corgi" would output the paternal tree of the dog named 'Corgi'.
